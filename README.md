# Battleship Instructions

## Description

Write detailed instructions on how to play a game of Battleship. Compose these instructions as if they were written for a computer interacting with a human.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Gain an understanding of the specificity needed while instructing computers.
* Appreciate the inherent complexities in real-world activities (that is, we do more things without thinking about them than we realize).

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively...

* Identify when the broad notions of "if" and "while" come into play in real-world activities (like playing a game of battleship).
* Write documentation in Markdown.
* Create gists.

## Details

### Deliverables

* A [gist](https://gist.github.com/) containing one file called `battleship.md`.

## Normal Mode

Write detailed instructions on how to play a game of Battleship. Compose these instructions as if they were written for a computer interacting with a human.  For example, one possible instruction is "Ask the human player for his/her next shot."  Or, if you're feeling like a rather malicious computer: "Ask the weak human scum for its next shot.  Laugh at its ignorance.  Plot takeover of the world."

(Just kidding.  Don't do that last one.)

Use the [Hasbro instructions](http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/battleship.pdf) for details. You can ignore the section on the SALVO variant of the game (for now... mwah ha ha).

You will be using these instructions to write a program later this weekend, and they will work as a map for you while learning during the next few days. Once you have written these instructions, go to https://gist.github.com/ and paste them into a file there. Name the file "battleship.md" and e-mail a link to your instructor.

## Hard Mode

In addition, write instructions for the SALVO version of the game.  Submit this as a second file called `salvo.md`.
